<h2>Back up for all my DS&A practice in C/C++</h2>
<p>

I'm taking Data Structures and Algorithms at school starting in a few weeks,
    so this is my preparation. The class will be taught in Java, so I plan to
    continue working in here throughout the semester as supplemental learning.
    

    I'm implenting in C/C++ to better understand how these data structures 
    truly work without Java's abstractions.</p>
